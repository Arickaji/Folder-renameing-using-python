This program you need to import the os module.
In this progrm I am use 3 argument in the function 1 is path , 2 is file path,3 is format.
1 You enter the path and 2 you enter the file full path and 3 is a specific extension like png file,jpg file etc.
And you enter the full 3 argument yor file is ready.
If you enter the wrong input program is show the error "Something wrong, check your path, file and format".
